# Casino
(Fall 2020)<br>The purpose of this semester-long project was to create a working Casino application and update it throughout the semester with multiple games (such as BlackJack, Scratch Offs, and Slots) for the user to play as well as a UI for the user to interact with, as long as they have enough money.
